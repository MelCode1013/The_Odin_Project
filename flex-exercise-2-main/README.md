# flex-exercise-2
2nd Flexbox exercise from the Odin Project

Solution: I had to center the "logo" and keep the left/right links on their respective sides as the page shrinks and expands.
* Added "Display: flex, justify-content:space-between;, align-items: center;" for header.
* Also added padding for header.
* Removed padding/margin from ul (leftover from bullet point removal).
* Added padding between li.
