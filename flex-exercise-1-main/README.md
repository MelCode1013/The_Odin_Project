# flex-exercise-1
The first exercise in Flexbox from The Odin Project

The exercise was to center the red box in the middle of the page. This is the intro to Flexbox. .Container was the flex container in which I just needed to add the following:
* Display: flex;
* justify-content: center;
* align-items: center;
